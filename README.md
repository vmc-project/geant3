# Geant3 + VMC

Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) defines a detector simulation framework that allows to run different simulation Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input and output format as well as the geometry and detector response definition.

This repository **geant3** includes the **Geant3.21**  and the [TGeant3 (Geant3 VMC)](https://vmc-project.github.io/user-guide/geant3+vmc) package implementing the Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) interface for Geant3.21.
